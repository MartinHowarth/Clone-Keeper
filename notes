Graphics:
Each entity has sprite sheet:
    one row for each state
    variable length rows - would need to assign length in the .json for each obj
    column = frame
Entity is created without graphics, but with a graphics setting dict
    post custom pygame event saying "please create graphics for me"
    graphics handler picks up event, create graphics and assigns it to the obj
    ...
    state changes -> post state change graphics event
    enters/leave drawable screen -> post enable/disable graphics event
    -> graphics thread *only* draws a given list (w/ layers), no logic

Each entity has .json that describes it - no hardcoded settings?
    graphics dict within this:
        spritesheet file name/location
        possible graphical states, with row number and # of columns
        frame dimensions - aim for standard size, but doesn't really matter - scale on load
    AI?!?!
