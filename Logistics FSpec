Four main types:
- suppliers
- distributors / storage
- requesters
- carriers


Suppliers somehow gain items (e.g. production building)
When full they tell their closest distribution centre to perform an off-cycle pickup (e.g. if the DC is not picking up
fast enough.
They receive requests for items.
    - This flags those items as "taken" but they still reside in the supplier (until picked up).
        - The flags can be removed if the carrier (for whatever reason) isn't going to come
            - Cancelled request
            - The carrier gets killed

They receive notification events about new DC's.
    - subscribe to DC mailing list upon creation
    - keep record of closest DC only
    - Will NOT find a second closest DC if the first one is full (subject to revisement)


Distribution centres:
Periodically pulls from suppliers who have subscribed to this DC (i.e. the suppliers that are closer to this DC than
any other DC)
Limit storage of unrequested items to 75% of total space
    - this prevents blockages
    - when at 75% capacity:
        - if a request is received, and the item is present, fulfil request and then request from supplier to refill
        - item is not present, request from supplier and allow filling above 75% for this item.
            - Try to keep 3x requests in stock (allowed to go above 75%)
                - This is a cumulative thing, i.e. if multiple places ask for items, keep 3x total requested
                - This cannot be requested by other DC's
                - Ensure deleted suppliers release their requests


Requesters: (e.g. manufacturing building)
Requests up to given limit
    - This could be simply 3x the required per-cycle resources
    - Or it could be fill an arbitrary sized inventory
        - This would be weighted in allocated size according to production-cycle resources
        - However, production is a separate thing, and that will have to tell the requester what to get
Given a certain request:
    - Ask all suppliers on a closest-first basis and place request (partial requests possible) until satisfied
        - stop asking once reach nearest DC
    - Failing that, ask nearest DC for the item
Subscribes to item_id mailing list when a request for that type of item is added
